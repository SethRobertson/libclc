	* include/fsma.h: avoid Linux gcc warnings about signed vs. unsigned

	* include/dict.h (DICT_NUKE_CONTENTS): Generic macro to spin through
	CLC using user code to nuke each item.

	* (ERRNO): errno shadows global errno which is sometimes a manifest constant
	to a function or something silly like that.

	* Change error handling.  Specifically, get rid of errno pointer
	and create functions to access the error value as a string.  This
	supports automatic reentrancy except from during dictionary creation
	(which is either programmer error or an out-of-memory condition).

	Add DICT_NOCOALESCE to allow reentrancy.

	Delete DICT_RETURN_ERROR -- never exit.
	
	Change indention to BAKA style.

	* src/dict/htimpl.h: Fix indention

	* src/fsma/fsma.c (fsm_destroy): Nuke __ARGS() && cleanup c++ warnings

	* include/ bst.h dict.h dll.h fsma.h hpq.h ht.h pq.h: Sanify indention style.
	Nuke __ARGS() -- all compilers are ANSI compatible && need function prototypes
