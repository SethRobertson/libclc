	* src/dict/dictimpl.h (HANDLE_ERROR): Eliminate unused id argument
	[use __FUNCTION__  here instead if you need it for debugging]

2002-01-31  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* src/dict/Makefile (BK_LARGE_LIB): use ${LIBEXT} for libtool build

2002-01-09  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* src/fsma/fsma.c: INSIGHT->INSURE

	* src/dict/ht.c: disable SWITCH_HT_TO_DLL hack - probably not needed

	* include/clchack.h: get rid of obsolete insure/bsdos2 -specific hacks

2001-11-05  Seth Robertson  <seth@startide.sysdetect.com>

	* src/dict/*: Change _iterate/nextobj interface to be re-entrant.
	NOTE THIS IS ONLY AN INTERFACE CHANGE--IT IS STILL NOT RE-ENTRANT.
	However, at least it can be pretty easily converted to re-entrant
	without affecting anyone else.

2001-11-02  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* src/dict/bst.c (find_object_in_tree): fix bug in delete or nested
	iteration of bst with non-unique keys

2001-09-30  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* include/hpq.h: Create typedef for pq comparison function

2001-09-17  Alexander Dupuy  <dupuy@sysdetect.com>

	* include/fsma.h: avoid Linux gcc warnings about signed vs. unsigned

	* include/fsma.c: avoid Linux gcc warnings about signed vs. unsigned

2001-08-16  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* include/dict.h (DICT_NUKE_CONTENTS): Generic macro to spin through
	CLC using user code to nuke each item.

2001-07-07  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* (ERRNO): errno shadows global errno which is sometimes a manifest constant
	to a function or something silly like that.

2001-07-06  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* Change error handling.  Specifically, get rid of errno pointer
	and create functions to access the error value as a string.  This
	supports automatic reentrancy except from during dictionary creation
	(which is either programmer error or an out-of-memory condition).

	Add DICT_NOCOALESCE to allow reentrancy.

	Delete DICT_RETURN_ERROR -- never exit.
	
	Change indention to BAKA style.

2001-07-05  Seth Robertson  <seth@yeah.baka.org>

	* src/dict/htimpl.h: Fix indention

	* src/fsma/fsma.c (fsm_destroy): Nuke __ARGS() && cleanup c++ warnings

	* include/ bst.h dict.h dll.h fsma.h hpq.h ht.h pq.h: Sanify indention style.
	Nuke __ARGS() -- all compilers are ANSI compatible && need function prototypes
