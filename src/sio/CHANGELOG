1.0.x-1.4.x:
	-	These version have not been released.

1.5.0:
	-	Added the function Smorefds
	-	Improved the handling of pointers in Sprint

1.5.3:
	-	Fixed a bug in Srdline

1.5.6:
	-	Added multiple ways of determining the number of available fds

1.6.0:
	-	Updated the way SIO is configured. Instead of multiple configuration
		files, one per OS/machine, there is now a single configuration header
		file where the user can define via preprocessor flags the features
		supported by the particular OS/machine.

1.6.1:
	-	Simplified the Sprint-related configuration flags
	-	Fixed a bug in the events code
	-	Replaced all uses of memcpy with sio_memcopy

1.6.2:
	-	Fixed a bug in the INS_CHAR macro: the buffer size was not respected
		when printing to strings. This had no effect on the SIO library,
		but it did affect the strx_* functions of the STR library

1.6.3:
	-	The values for INCLUDEDIR and MANDIR in the Makefile were reversed
		(this might have been confusing to people trying to install the
		library).
	-	Updated the sio manpage with respect to the handling of interrupted
		system calls.
